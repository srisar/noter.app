# noter.app

noter is a small note-taking app that utilized the html5 storage mechanism to temporarily and quickly store what you have written.

the purpose of this simple, mostly useless app is to keep track of notes which need google input tools (tamil) to be able to type on. this is why desktop solutions donâ€™t work for me. Since i write articles for my blog, i use markdown for styling, so as an added feature, i have added markdown preview and download options.

it uses marked for markdown preview and vue.js for the ui.

if you find it useful, i will be glad.

it is available at https://vercel-noter-app.vercel.app/

apart from being simple and plain, it allows you to drag and drop local text / markdown files to be opened immediately.
